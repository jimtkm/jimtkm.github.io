I killed my old blog again, <del>but all the entries are still available at my tumblog, I think they suit better at [Tumblr][tum].</del>

<del>I am using [Ghost][gh] now, although</del> I might switch over to [Jekyll][jek] in near future. <del>But right now, [Ghost][gh] is pretty much what I need for blogging.</del> I will try to update this blog often, at least once a month. Yeah, I'll do just that.

**Update:** Site runs <del>[WordPress][wp]</del> [Jekyll][jek] now.
