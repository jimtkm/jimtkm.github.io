title: 2016 Resolutions
excerpt: "The yearly TO-DO list."
---
Every year I had almost the same resolutions, things like *less beer*, *sleep more*, *workout regularly*, *drink more water* and so on. Not really working for me, specially the *beer* part.

This year, I have only 3 in my personal list;

- **Workout regularly** - I will try to workout 4-5 times each week, run more, ride more.
- **Take more photos** - I want to take more photo, more meaningful photos, not just snapshot.
- **Learn a new language** - Learn something, Japanese, Thai or Vietnamese. Just learn somethng.

And for my geek list;

- **Emacs as my only editor** - I been using VI since 90s, recently I got hooked on *org-mode*...
- **Redesign _jimtkm.com_** - Need to switch this to Jekyll, need `collection` for photosets.
- **Stop using platform-dependent apps** - Apps like OmniFocus, Day One, and such. Any apps that I can't use while on other platform (Linux/BSD), I need to stop using all these.
- **Transfer all domains out of GoDaddy** - Elephant killer?

That's my resolutions, happy 2016 people!
